# Document Scanner with JavaScript
This project is a simple yet efficient document scanner implemented in JavaScript, leveraging image processing techniques to enhance scanned documents.

# Key Features
Binary Image Conversion: Transforms the input image into a binary image for easier processing.
Otsu's Method: Automatically determines the optimal threshold to separate foreground (text) from the background.
Gaussian Blur: Applies a smoothing filter to reduce noise and improve the visual quality of the binary image.
# Technologies Used
JavaScript: For implementing all the algorithms from scratch.
Canvas API: For rendering and processing image data.
# How It Works
Input: Load an image of a document (e.g., a photo or scanned copy).
Binary Image Processing: The image is converted into a binary format using Otsu's thresholding.
Noise Reduction: A Gaussian blur is applied to enhance the result, creating a cleaner and sharper scanned document effect.
Output: The processed image is displayed for download or further use.
# Use Cases
Digitizing handwritten or printed documents.
Creating high-quality black-and-white document scans.
# Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/document-scanner-js.git
Open index.html in a browser.
Upload an image and view the processed output.
# Future Improvements
Add real-time scanning via webcam integration.
Include additional filters for color document enhancement.
Support for saving output in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, PNG).
# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the project.
